# UTM Latex Template

This is a Latex template for thesis reports at Technical University of Moldova.
Check it out on Overleaf: https://www.overleaf.com/read/hmfqmkbzqmrb#b8d217

Writing the thesis report in Latex has become easier than doing it in Word.

If an adviser says something is wrong in this template,
please share your changes here with a pull request,
or raise an issue if you can't fix it yourself.

## Usage

The best way is to use Overleaf.
Alternatively you can run Latex on your own machine, but that is more complicated and probably not worth it.

## History

The first version was made by [Vasile Drumea](https://github.com/DrVasile/simplified-pbl-project-report-template) in 2022.
This version has a few formatting fixes, automatic bibliography formatting with bibtex, and simpler code.
There were at least 6 students from FAF-21x who successfully passed the evaluation using Vasile Drumea's template, with some fixes.
In this template we tried to aggregate all our changes.
